### Description
This is a resource pack for the mod [Embers Rekindled](https://modrinth.com/mod/embers) that retextures some blocks and items from the mod to improve them in accordance with my personal tastes and make them fit better with Minecraft's modern textures. I plan to redo most of the textures in the mod, however there is no estimate for when this will be completed.

This pack currently only supports the 1.20.1 version of the mod. Support may be added for the 1.12.2 version.

### Terms
 - You may modify this pack as you wish for personal use.
 - Do not claim this pack as your own.
